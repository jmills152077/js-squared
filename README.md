# js-squared
A simple to use, lightweight library written in pure JS for graphing mathematic expressions.

At its most simple, JS-Squared takes a container element and a function to graph, and produces a beautiful, easy to read graph. 

If you want more control, JS-Squared allows you full control over the styling of the graph - including the axis labels, grid spacing, color, line style, and more.

There are built-in functions to graph common families of functions, such as linear, quadratic, trigonometric, and more.
